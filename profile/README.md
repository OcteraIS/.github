## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This org hosts repositories and data for the Octera Research Group run by @neilernst.

New students should read material in [Onboarding[(https://github.com/OcteraIS/Onboarding). 

Student theses are in the [thesis repo](https://github.com/OcteraIS/theses) (cue sad shake of the head for no more hardcopy theses ...)
