## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This org hosts repositories and data for the Octera Research Group run by [@neilernst](https://neilernst.net).

New students should read material in [Onboarding](https://github.com/OcteraIS/Onboarding). Prospective students [see here](https://github.com/neilernst/neilernst.github.io/blob/master/prospective).

Student theses are in the [thesis repo](https://github.com/OcteraIS/theses) (cue sad shake of the head for no more hardcopy theses ...)
